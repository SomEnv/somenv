Description: Self-Organizing Map algorithm application for the analysis of multivariate environmental high frequency data. This package is dedicated to the analysis of multivariate environmental high frequency data by Self-Organizing Map and k-means clustering algorithms. By means of the graphical user interface it provides a confortable way to elaborate by self-organizing map algorithm rather big datasets (txt files up to 100 MB ) obtained by environmental high-frequency monitoring by sensors/instruments. The functions present in the package are based on kohonen and openair packages implemented by functions embedding Vesanto et al. (2001) <https://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/somtoolbox/ package/papers/techrep.pdf>  heuristic rules for map inizialization parameters, kmeans clustering algorithm and map features visualization. Cluster profiles visualization as well as graphs dedicated to the visualization of time-dependent variables Licen et al. (2020) <doi:10.4209/aaqr.2019.08.0414> are provided.
